# ATM-Application-using-Java

In Java, I created an ATM program for representing ATM transection. In the ATM program, the user has to select an option from the options displayed on the screen. 
The options are related to show transaction history, withdraw the money, deposit the money, transfer the money, and exit. 
There are 2 types of accounts of user, savings and the current account.
To show transaction history, user have to select the account type (savings-1, current -2), then that particular account transaction history will be displayed.
To withdraw the money, first user need to select the account type-no., then we will get the withdrawal amount from the user and remove that amount from the total balance and print the current balances of both accounts.
To deposit the money, first user need to select the account type-no., then we get the deposit amount from the user, add it to the total balance and print the current balances of both accounts.
To transfer the money, user needs to select the account to transfer from and the account to transfer to, and then the amount to transfer will be entered by user, and then the transfer will be done printing the current balances of both accounts.
